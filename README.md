Babushka is a mid bootcamp project, built by a team of 4 of Le Wagon's London part-time Web Development Course, Batch #525. It follows the Air BnB model whereby a user can search and review Grandmas or Grandpas who they'd like to spend time with for company, or a Grandma or Grandpa can sign up and review their requests from other users. It was built on Rails with Ruby, JS, CSS and HTML. Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
